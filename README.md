# MySQL Employee Tracker
Keep track of all your business' employees, departments, and roles with this handy app!
## Description
Want an easy way to manage your employees and their respective roles and departments? Not a problem! You can download this app and use a terminal to manage and/or add your business' employees, roles, and departments.
### Why did I make this?
I wanted to give people managing growning businesses an easier time when it comes to keeping track of thier workers and departments.
### What problem does this solve?
For any quickly growing business, it can become hard to keep track of employees and thier roles. With this app, business managers can have an easier time keeping track of who is who, who works in which department, and which role is best suited for which department.
### What did I learn?
I learned how to connect JavaScript files to MySQL by using a handy little npm package called mySQL2. I'm also still learning how to use the Inquirer npm package to add new entries to a table in a MySQL table.
